# About CipherMaster

CipherMaster started as a fun side project to explore how encryption techniques like Caesar, ROT13, and Morse code work. Over time, it became a full utility with multiple cipher systems, clipboard integration, and even its own unique encoding format.
It's designed to be a bit Retro and be fully Terminal based because it was never meant to become a full on App.

# Remixing & Credits

You're more than allowed to remix or extend CipherMaster! If you do, please make sure to give proper credit. A short note like “Based on CipherMaster” is all that's needed.
